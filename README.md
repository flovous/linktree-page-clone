# Linktree Page Clone with Plain HTML & CSS

Hello there, I am flovous, and I made my own Linktree page clone with only HTML and CSS. This is a GitHub repo for my viewers who might need the source code from the video.

Feel free to make pull requests and suggest some changes, because to be honest, it was not rigorously planned and designed, just a bunch of code I put together to match the Linktree page layout.
